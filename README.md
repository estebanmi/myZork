INTRO:
You were part of a secret team developing a new bio weapon in a hidden base underwater. 
When the project was done, you were betrayed and attacked by the soldiers.Fortunately, under the lifeless body of one of your friends, 
they left you for dead... Now, when all you can hear is silence, just you and a lot of bodies, remain on the lower floor. With no time 
to feel safe, you realize that water is entering all over the base and soon will flood all... Run!

COMMENTS: 
There are some things that I don't know with precision how to do, and a lot of others that I wanted to do but I couldn't, so I dicarded 'em. 
I have a lot to learn yet, especially class pointers and how to transfer data between cpps/h. 
I've learnt a lot doing this Zork but it was too hard and some knowledges weren't learnt. 
I tried to put some methods in player.cpp out of world.cpp but id didn't work.
